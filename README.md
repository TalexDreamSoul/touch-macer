# TouchMacer

TouchMacer is a native macOS status bar clock app built with AppKit, SwiftUI, EventKit, and Foundation.

## Features

- Configurable menu-bar date/time formatting with structured controls, advanced Unicode patterns, live preview, validation, and reset.
- Ordered system/custom world-clock carousel with drag reordering, custom labels, timed rotation, and mouse-wheel or trackpad switching directly over the status item. Manual gesture selection pauses timed rotation until **Auto Rotate** is selected.
- Overview popover with world clocks, current system time zone, and upcoming events, plus a sidebar settings window for clock formatting, time zones, iCloud Sync, Calendar filters, appearance, app info, and update checks.
- EventKit Calendar integration for iCloud/local calendars configured in macOS Calendar.
- Calendar picker for all calendars or selected calendars.
- Appearance modes: system, light, dark, or automatic by a selected time zone, with an optional switch to apply the result to macOS system Light/Dark appearance.
- Native Launch at Login control through macOS Service Management.
- Packaged macOS app icon for Finder, the Dock, and system Login Items.
- Local settings persistence through `UserDefaults`, with opt-in iCloud key-value synchronization for portable preferences in entitlement-enabled builds.
- Configurable 4×2 Quick Actions grid with up to seven pinned actions and a fixed More entry.
- Fourteen built-in macOS actions plus Apple Shortcuts discovery, execution, availability feedback, and ordering in Settings.

## Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask talexdreamsoul/tap/touchmacer
```

The current release is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If macOS blocks the first launch, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway** for TouchMacer.

## Build

```bash
swift build
```

## Build App Bundle

Calendar permissions, the packaged icon, and Launch at Login require the app bundle. Use:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build-app.sh
scripts/build-app.sh
open .build/app/TouchMacer.app
```

The default command keeps the ad-hoc GitHub build local-only. To embed an iCloud-enabled provisioning profile and sign with an Apple identity, provide `CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, and `PROVISIONING_PROFILE`:

```bash
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name" \
APPLE_TEAM_ID="YOURTEAMID" \
PROVISIONING_PROFILE="/path/to/TouchMacer.provisionprofile" \
scripts/build-app.sh
```

## Notes

- Calendar data continues to come from macOS Calendar/EventKit; TouchMacer never stores iCloud credentials or duplicates calendar contents. Entitlement-enabled builds can separately sync portable display preferences through `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`; ad-hoc builds hide this capability and remain local-only.
- Automatic appearance uses light mode from 07:00 to 19:00 in the selected reference time zone, and dark mode otherwise.
- System-level appearance switching requires macOS Automation permission and is disabled until you enable it in Settings. When enabled, TouchMacer periodically corrects macOS if another automatic schedule changes Light/Dark mode away from the selected setting.
